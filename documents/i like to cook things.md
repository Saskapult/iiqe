Hi! My name is Katherine and I like to cook things. I will now describe a few things that I like to cook. 

Yam curry is delicious. Yams are not sweet potatoes! My family would call sweet potatoes yams because that's what stores call them. Yams are actually something totally different! Anyway, if you combine yams, chickpeas, tomatoes, and a bunch of other spices then you can make a really nice curry. The yams are nicely textured and add a lot to the experience. 

I like to make a potato and lentil stew in the fall. I grow a special variety of potatoes kind of specifically for this. They aren't very starchy and do not break down as badly as russets do in this recipe. I've made this stew (or some variety of it) at a few public cooks. It turns out I'm pretty good at making a soup base! I like to add a lot of onion, some carrots for sweetness, and celery for extra zazz. 

Some things to know about teas:
- Hops tea is delicious! Pick it, dry it, and just throw a hop in some boiling water. By the time it fully cools it will be bitter. 
- Do not put silica gel from seaweed containers into your tea jars. It is a bad idea. I know this well now. 
- It is fun hang things from my ceiling fan to dry. 

Deer are evil and cannot be satisfied by sacrificial plants. If the deer do not eat my tomatoes then a squirrel comes and rips them out. It rips out the whole plant! 

Salt your tomatoes 15 minutes before putting them on a sandwich! It makes them tastier. Tomato toast is a great summer snack. I'd have eaten a lot of it this year if the deer hadn't eaten my tomatoes. 

I can reach campus in 10 minutes by riding my bike! 
It's a lot faster than using the bus because the bus only visits every hour. 
It also stops running after 19h00 which is really not great. 
The transit system in this city is severely lacking. 
But! 
My bike is awesome. 

Every now and then I update my computer and reboot and then move the mouse and I'm like "huh, this is ass" and it's because libinput is active and I just cannot. 

Today I licked some milkcap liquid. It is spicy like horseradish! Quite unpleasant, glad that I tried it.
